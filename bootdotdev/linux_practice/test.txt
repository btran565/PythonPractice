Renaming a file:

mv some_file.txt some_other_name.txt

Moving a file from the current directory to another nested directory:

mv some_file.txt some_directory/some_file.txt

Moving a file from the current directory, to the parent directory:

mv some_file.txt ../some_file.txt

If you don't want to rename the file and you're just moving it to a different directory, you can omit the filename:

mv some_file.txt some_directory/
