Interrupt
Sometimes a program will get stuck and you'll want to stop it. Common reasons for this are:

You made a typo in the command and it's not doing what you want
It's trying to access the internet but you're not connected
It's processing too much data and you don't want to wait for it to finish
There is a bug in the program causing it to hang
In these cases, you can stop the program by pressing ctrl + c. This sends a "SIGINT" signal to the program, which tells it to stop.

Assignment
Inside the worldbanc/private/bin/ directory, there is a program called malicious.sh. Sounds scary!

As a good security auditor, and knowing that you are on a secure system with no internet access, you want to see what this program does! Go ahead and run it!

It will run forever if you let it... use ctrl + c to send a SIGINT signal to the program and stop it.
