Standard Error
"Standard Error", usually called "stderr", is a data stream just like standard output, but is intended to be used for error messages.

It's a separate stream so that you can redirect it to a different place if need be, but by default, it prints to your terminal just like stdout.

Redirecting Streams
You can redirect stdout and stderr to different places using the > and 2> operators. > redirects stdout, and 2> redirects stderr.

Redirect stdout to a File
echo "Hello world" > hello.txt
cat hello.txt
# Hello world

Redirect stderr to a File
cat doesnotexist.txt 2> error.txt
cat error.txt
# cat: doesnotexist.txt: No such file or directory

In this example, cat is used to intentionally generate an error message (since the file doesn't exist), which is then redirected to error.txt.

Assignment
There is a process_transactions.sh script in the worldbanc/private/bin directory.

It accepts a path to a CSV file containing transactions data as a positional argument (or CLI argument)
It prints modern transactions (after the year 2000) to stdout, and old transactions (before the year 2000) to stderr
Run the script using the path to the 2020.csv file in the worldbanc/private/transactions directory as an argument. Be sure to redirect stderr to a temporary file called /tmp/worldbanc.log.
If you're missing 2020.csv, you made a mistake in a previous step. Ensure the files in transactions match the files in transactions/backups. If not, make a copy. Alternatively, manually copy the file contents from GitHub.

cat the /tmp/worldbanc.log file to see the old transactions.
Paste those transactions into the text field and submit your answer.
