The remove command deletes a file or empty directory:

rm some_file.txt

You can optionally add a -r flag to tell the rm command to delete a directory and all of its contents recursively. "Recursively" is just a fancy way of saying "do it again on all of the subdirectories and their contents".

rm -r some_directory
