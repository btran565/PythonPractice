Standard In
If there's a standard output, there must be a standard input, right?

"Standard Input", usually called "standard in" or "stdin", is the default place where programs read their input. It's just a stream of data that programs can read from as they run.

All major programming languages provide a simple way to read from stdin. In Python, it's the input function:

# execution stops until the user types
# something (in this case "Lane") and presses enter
name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Hello,", name)
# Hello, Lane!
