Shell Configuration
Bash and Zsh both have configuration files that run automatically each time you start a new shell session. These files are used to set up your shell environment. They can be used to set up aliases, functions, and environment variables.

These files are located in your home directory (~) and are hidden by default. The ls command has a -a flag that will show hidden files:

ls -a ~

If you're using Bash, .bashrc is probably the file you want to edit.
If you're using Zsh, .zshrc is probably the file you want to edit or create if it doesn't yet exist.
