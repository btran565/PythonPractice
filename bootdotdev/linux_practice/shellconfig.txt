Shell Configuration
Bash and Zsh both have configuration files that run automatically each time you start a new shell session. These files are used to set up your shell environment. They can be used to set up aliases, functions, and environment variables.

These files are located in your home directory (~) and are hidden by default. The ls command has a -a flag that will show hidden files:

ls -a ~

If you're using Bash, .bashrc is probably the file you want to edit.
If you're using Zsh, .zshrc is probably the file you want to edit or create if it doesn't yet exist.

Assignment
As part of your audit, you're trying to figure out what shell commands run automatically when a user logs in on the machine. You need to confirm which shell configuration file is being used.

Edit the file you believe to be your shell configuration file. You can use the nano command to edit files in your terminal:
nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line to the bottom:
echo "Hello from the shell!"

You can use Ctrl+O to save the file (confirm any prompts with "enter"), and then Ctrl+X to exit the editor. (There should be a list of commands at the bottom of the screen.)

Close your terminal and open a new one. If you see the message "Hello from the shell!", you've found the right file!
Edit ~/.bashrc again to remove the line you added to the file so that you don't see that message every time you open a new shell.
