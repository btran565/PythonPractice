Package Managers
A package manager is a software tool that helps you install other software. Its primary functions include:

Downloading software from official sources
Installing software
Updating software
Removing software
Managing dependencies
As a developer, you'll frequently use package managers to get access to the software you need to get your work done.

APT (Ubuntu)
APT, or "Advanced Package Tool", is the primary package manager for Ubuntu. To be fair, you can use other package managers on Ubuntu, but APT is the default and most common.

If you're on WSL and Ubuntu, you'll be using APT. If you're on another Linux setup, I pray you already know what package manager you're using. If you're on WSL or Ubuntu, check to make sure you have APT installed by running the following command:

apt --version

Brew (macOS)
There isn't a "default" package manager for macOS. The most popular (but unofficial) package manager is Homebrew.

If you're on macOS, and you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

See the Homebrew site for more information if needed.

Assignment
Let's install something! Neovim is a hyperextensible (and newer) version of Vim, which is a "new" version of Vi, which is a popular command line text editor.

WSL/Ubuntu Instructions
First, make sure that apt itself is up to date and will install the latest version of Neovim. Run the following command:

sudo apt update

This command only upgrades apt, it doesn't upgrade anything else.

Next, install Neovim:

sudo apt install neovim

macOS Instructions
If you're using Homebrew, on Mac, you can install Neovim by running the following command:

brew install neovim

Other Installation Methods
If the above methods don't work, you can try other installation methods.

Check Installation
Let's make sure we installed it properly. Check your version:

nvim --version
