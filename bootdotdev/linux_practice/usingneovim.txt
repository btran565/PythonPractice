Using Neovim
This isn't a course on Neovim (we'd need at least 420 more lessons for that), but let's at least figure out how to edit a file and exit the program.

Don't be fooled, exiting Vim (or Neovim) is one of the greatest hurdles you must overcome as a developer. It's a rite of passage. It's a badge of honor.



Assignment
There's a public file containing a company password!

Use Neovim to open the worldbanc/public/company_info.md file.
It's a text file that's using markdown syntax. You can open a file with Neovim by passing in the file path as an argument:

nvim FILEPATH_HERE

Once it's open, you might notice that you can't type anything. That's because you're in "normal" mode, the mode for navigating and manipulating text.

Use the arrow keys (I know, Vim sacrilege) to move your cursor down to the last line.
Enter "insert" mode by pressing the i key. You should see -- INSERT -- appear at the bottom of the screen.
You should now be able to delete the password. Replace just the password with the text "REDACTED" in all caps, no quotes.
When you're done, press the esc key to return to normal mode.
Then type :w and press enter to save your changes.
Finally, type :q and press enter to quit Neovim.
You've successfully edited a file (and escaped from) Neovim!

Use cat to view the contents of the edited file. Paste the contents into the input field and submit it
