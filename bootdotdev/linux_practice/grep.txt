The grep Command
The grep command allows you to search for text in files. It has a ton of capability, and we'll only be scratching the surface of its true power.

Basic Usage
The most basic use for grep is to search for a string in a file. For example, if we wanted to search for the word "hello" in the file words.txt, we could run:

grep "hello" words.txt

This will print out every line in words.txt that contains the word "hello". It's a case-sensitive search, so it will only match "hello", not "Hello" or "HELLO".


grep Multiple Files
You can also search multiple files at once. For example, if we wanted to search for the word "hello" in hello.txt and hello2.txt, we could run:

grep "hello" hello.txt hello2.txt

Recursive Search
You can also search an entire directory, including all subdirectories. For example, to search for the word "hello" in the current directory and all subdirectories:

grep -r "hello" .

The . is a special alias for the current directory.
