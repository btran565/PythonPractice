Flags
As you've already seen in this course, some commands accept flags. Flags are options that you can pass to a command to change its behavior.

For example, the ls command can take a -l flag to show a "long" listing of files:

ls -l

Or the -a flag to show "all" files, including hidden files:

ls -a

You can also combine flags:

ls -al

Conventions
Whether or not a command takes flags, and what those flags are, is up to the developer of the command. That said there are some common conventions:

Single-character flags are prefixed with a single dash (.e.g -a)
Multi-character flags are prefixed with two dashes (e.g. --help)
Sometimes the same flag can be used with a single dash or two dashes (e.g. -h or --help)
