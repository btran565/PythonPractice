Find
The find command is a powerful tool for finding files and directories by name, not by their contents.

Find a File by Name
Let's say you're looking for a file named hello.txt somewhere in your home directory. You can use the find command to search for exactly that title:

find some_directory -name hello.txt

Pattern Search
The find command can also search for files that match a pattern. For example, if you wanted to find all files that end in .txt, you could run:

find some_directory -name "*.txt"

The * character is a wildcard that matches anything. If you're trying to find filenames that contain a specific word, you can use the * character to match the rest of the filename:

# Find all filenames that contain the word "chad"
find some_directory -name "*chad*"

Assignment
There seems to be a suspicious script in the worldbanc/private/bin directory called genids.sh. It looks like it generates some type of identifier... First, let's remove our ability to run it, just to see what happens. The chmod command has a convenient -x flag that will simply remove the executable permission from the file.

Run the following commands in worldbanc/private/bin:
chmod -x genids.sh

Let's test those permission changes. Try to run the script:
./genids.sh

You should get an error like this:

permission denied

That error occurs because the executable permission has been removed. Let's re-add the executable permission for the owner:
chmod u+x <filename>

Once you've done that, try running the ./genids.sh script again.
Paste the output of the script into the input field and submit your answer.

Tips
You'll frequently download scripts from the internet to run on your machine, and often you'll need to make them executable before you can run them. I use chmod +x quite often as a developer.

The internet is a shady place. Only run verified scripts from trusted publishers and authors.
