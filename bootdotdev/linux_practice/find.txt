Find
The find command is a powerful tool for finding files and directories by name, not by their contents.

Find a File by Name
Let's say you're looking for a file named hello.txt somewhere in your home directory. You can use the find command to search for exactly that title:

find some_directory -name hello.txt

Pattern Search
The find command can also search for files that match a pattern. For example, if you wanted to find all files that end in .txt, you could run:

find some_directory -name "*.txt"

The * character is a wildcard that matches anything. If you're trying to find filenames that contain a specific word, you can use the * character to match the rest of the filename:

# Find all filenames that contain the word "chad"
find some_directory -name "*chad*"
